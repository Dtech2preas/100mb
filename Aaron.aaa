Plz fix the way the downloading outlay is shown in the search page cz as you see its over the results of what the user has search so after a few clicks they will completely cover the screen .. so make it that you mske it a small button streatching of side to side sayibg currently downloading this many songs (just below the search bar ) n above wherevthe results will start to appear n when that is clicked then you open a window for specific the currently downloading songs n their details.  N also i noted that theres only one X button.. i dont thinn thats sufficient cz we need to be able to pause .. continue and delete( i emphasize on the delete cz i waa that it wasn't working id click n the toaster to say songs deleted would appear but the songbwould still be there n just be paused for a few minutes a then continue again so make it the delete really delete n removes the songs ) 
Again sjow the actual song names there cz jow will users know which songs is which n one more things ..that visual effects thing inbthe button of the full screen player it doesn't work it doesn't respond it just sits there as you see on the screenshot 

If you have any other improvements or new features plz let me know
