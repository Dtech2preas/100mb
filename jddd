🔧 Next-Step Debugging Prompt

> We have confirmed that the VPN tunnel is successfully established:

TUN interface is created

SSH connection authenticates successfully

TLS handshake with SNI succeeds

Payload is sent and accepted


However, after connection:

The device has no internet access

Browsing fails on both mobile data and WiFi

Connection appears active but no traffic reaches the internet


The next objective is to diagnose why traffic is not flowing through the tunnel.

Please:

1. Explain the difference between tunnel establishment and actual traffic routing in a TUN-based VPN.


2. Identify the most likely causes of “connected but no internet” in this setup:

Missing or incorrect default route

DNS not being set or forwarded

SSH server traffic restrictions (zero-rated / SNI-only access)

Android VpnService configuration issues



3. Propose a step-by-step debug strategy to determine where packets stop:

How to verify packets are leaving the TUN interface

How to confirm packets reach the SSH server

How to detect whether responses are blocked or dropped



4. Define clear tests to distinguish:

Network instability vs routing misconfiguration

Endpoint limitation vs client-side bug



5.  n on a separste note make sure that the connect button n disconnect button work ...the connect button work ..but after it connects pressing the disconnect button does nothing ..n also make it that the connection on can also be pressed to stop the attempt
